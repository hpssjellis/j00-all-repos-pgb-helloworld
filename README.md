============================

A combination of all my repositories for Phonegap Build demonstration Apps




May 22. Serious waist of time. I made a brand new repo to solve the issue of plugins not working when they are in directories and now I just changed 
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../phonegap.js">
    
to a relative location and the plugins now work.

aaaaarrrrggggg!...





May 7, 2014. This works great with phonegap serve on both the iPad and Android, but many of the files in sub folders do not seem to work on phonegap build. So I am in the process of taking the files out of the folders.



Hopefully will be a set of example Hello World programs for Phonegap Build.

Try this link

for the new file that should work with phonegap build.
